*BLUF: No one is a rock or an island. Getting to any better future takes all hands on deck.*

What is the outcome of a life lived in high tech in the US? Not enough provided back to the world, but some lessons learned along the way:

* Anything worth building takes all of us and time
	* Most profitable, valuable products or services takes an ecosystem of other expertise beyond what you can bring on your own
	* One or two quarters isn't enough to go-to-market
	* How do you set delivery timeframe expectations when there are unknowns and future unanticipated issues?
	* Recent phenomenons of "small team, billion dollar valuation" (i.e. unicorns) - unethical, inequitable, and unsustainable; once paid out, who's left to grow and support that great idea? ([reddit: "dumb"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1arscgi/comment/kqlqtry/))
* People are the most complicated part of any system
	* [Cynefin](https://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-decision-making)) (Snowden, Boone) framework applied to people systems (sociological, organizational); applies to individuals on their journey, groups of individuals / teams, and large organizations
* ‘[The Right It](https://www.albertosavoia.com/therightit.html)’ comes faster through collaborations
	* Are you solving problems that are unique to you, or broadly applicable to others as well?
	* How do you know if you're on the right track?
		* Customer/consumer feedback is critical
		* "Pre-totyping" -> getting to the right questions, not simply answers that support assumptions
		* Deeper understanding and context about user's problems takes time and effort before you can abstract to greater value beyond immediate pain
* We share a future together, some more and some less than others
	* The products and services we contribute to affect others
		* Over 50,000 Consumer Product-Related Deaths in 2019 (ref: [CPSC, Sept. 2021](https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/ConsumerProductRelatedInjuriesandDeathsintheUnitedStates.pdf))
	* Bad effects resulting from a lack of quality often come from careless, ill-conceived, poorly informed, under-funded processes; 
		* "Startups": Canva, DoorDash, 23andMe, Zynga, and ... ChatGPT ([ref](https://www.electric.ai/blog/recent-big-company-data-breaches))
		* Institutional: Microsoft, Marriott, Samsung, AMEX, AT&T, Snowflake
		* Endemic: "Mother Of All Breaches" (MOAB) Jan 2024 ([ref](https://www.itgovernanceusa.com/blog/moab-the-implications-of-26-billion-records-breached))
		* "smash and grab" high tech business models collect and then leak PII; its no wonder that most recent generations increasingly use pseudonyms over their born identities; when playing a mobile game means you're leaked, still everyone's in
		* How would your day/week/year change if someone [secretly took over your SMS](https://intel471.com/blog/a-briefing-on-sim-hijacking)?
	* 'Good' effects (value that doesn't leak bigger problems) often take careful attention to detail, lots of user feedback, adequate funding, and time

Things don't get better unless we 'lean forward' and work to common, mutually beneficial ends. This takes others which takes competence and willingness to collaborate on how to work together.

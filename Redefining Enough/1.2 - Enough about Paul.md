* Anything worth building takes all of us and time
	* Most profitable, valuable products or services takes an ecosystem of other expertise beyond what you can bring on your own
	* One or two quarters isn't enough to go-to-market
	* How do you set delivery timeframe expectations when there are unknowns and future unanticipated issues
* People are the most complicated part of any system
	* [Cynefin](https://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-decision-making)) (Snowden, Boone) framework applied to people systems (sociological, organizational); applies to individuals on their journey, groups of individuals / teams, and large organizations
* ‘[The Right It](https://www.albertosavoia.com/therightit.html)’ comes faster through collaborations
	* Are you solving problems that are unique to you, or broadly applicable to others as well?
	* How do you know if you're on the right track?
		* Customer/consumer feedback is critical
		* "Pre-totyping" -> getting to the right questions, not simply answers that support assumptions
		* Deeper understanding and context about user's problems takes time and effort before you can abstract to greater value beyond immediate pain
* We share a future together, some more and some less than others
	* The products and services we contribute to affect others
	* Bad effects resulting from a lack of quality often come from careless, ill-conceived, poorly informed, under-funded processes
	* 'Good' effects (value that doesn't leak bigger problems) often take careful attention to detail, lots of user feedback, adequate funding, and time
	* Things don't get better unless we 'lean forward' and work to common, mutually beneficial ends

*BLUF: Career is simply the professional part of your journey, but not simple. Make your own maps, milestones, and trajectories.*

* Now versus later; your ideal trajectory and the complications that arise
* Three immediate aspects:
	* [[2.1 - Enough credentials]]
	* [[2.2 - Enough experience(s)]]
	* [[2.3 - Enough opportunity]]
* Narrow vs. broad focus
	* Career focus often constrains 'enough' to specific fields and domains
	* Not enough career focus leads to employment based on luck and circumstances
	* Focusing on foundational elements and topics (such as data analysis) early on in a career serve as building blocks that widen future opportunity surface areas

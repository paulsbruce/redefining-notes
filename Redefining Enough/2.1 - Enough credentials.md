	- [The Master's Trap](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-masters-trap) (Petersen, 2021)
		- "Credentialism" (Cottom, "Lower Ed", 2018)
		- Meritocracy - a common illness shared between high tech, edu, and management
	- High tech bubbles pop readily (market volatility as compared to commodities)
	- Be prepared to 'switch frequently' and deal with the 'switching costs' -> frugality is your friend, this is not a get-rich-quick space (anymore) in 2024
- Broad range of "level knowledge" is important
	- On why a degree matters...
		- Anecdote: [Ana Huddleston](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-h-8784802a/), co-founder, Harbor 9 Golf Gloucester MA
			- Undergrad in Organizational Studies, Grad MBA at Babson in Marketing
			- Currently: Communications at Converse, Prior: Liberty Mutual
			- "Exposes you to the lingo of others you'll need in your career; accounting basics go a long way to getting things done with finance and $2bn budgets
	- Perception and wisdom of the crowd vs. earned experience of management
- "Job requirements"
	- Most jobs require a degree because "what else is there?"; Petersen - "...easy way to winnow their applicant pools..."
	- Software Co's usually do this to 'thin out the crowd' (a forcing filter) but are secretly willing to relax this requirement for 'strong' candidates
	- Some fields require for good reason (health care, safety-related jobs, etc.)
	- Usually jobs that require an MS are serious about that; candidate needs to have more than just a cursory education, and also rely on industry/domain experiences
* A million others like you and me
	* Bad: competition for jobs
	* Good: shared needs and problems to solve
* There only one ‘actually you’ to own your own decisions
	* I have never made great financial investment decisions, other than my wife and kids; had I worked for as much money in my 20s as possible and invested it wisely, I would be in a very different position than I am now
* You are the best person to define your passion
	* Though others may inspire you, you're the one with something that keeps you up at night (sometimes)
	* "Do what you love" is bad advice; doing what you hate isn't good, but most of us don't have this privilege so we have to find a balance of what we are compelled to or convicted we must do and what is profitable enough to do
	* Passion only gets you so far; too much passion and people look at you funny
	* It takes personal time and effort to know what you just can't get away from feeling is worth your time on earth; try things, collaborate, and don't give up
* Invest early in things that have 'payoff longevity'
	* Undergraduate and graduate degrees ... no one can ever take that away from you once you earn it; finish what you start when you can and move on
	* Internships at well-known institutions and organizations
	* 'Associate...' is sometimes the only way to get in to a field/vocation (product management)
	* Certifications are often short-lived in their applicability but useful proofs of 'continuous next' efforts

If you have the opportunity to complete a degree, do so because it gets harder the older you are. You are not alone, but are responsible to make good decisions for yourself. Passion isn't enough for long-term professional success, but sometimes differentiates you from others.

* How many graduates vs. how many open jobs at an entry level or higher
	* Graduation stats
		* 4-5% YoY increase; doubled from 2013-2023 (ref: [NSCH](https://www.studentclearinghouse.org/nscblog/computer-science-has-highest-increase-in-bachelors-earners/))
	* [Thread](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/over-supply-of-cs-grads/3667125/4): does an over-supply really signal greater difficulty in getting a job?
	* [SIU summary](https://cs.siu.edu/jobsvsgrads-image.php) of BLS data, CS jobs vs. grads: despite a rush on tech edu, still worth getting some
* There's always more than enough work to do
	* Despite the GenAI trends, most automation still requires skilled human eyes and exercise to prove correctness, completeness, stability, and reliability
	* Budgets often define what's being worked on more than it is need
	* AI is the current "Hail Mary" in the post-pandemic economic landscape to attract funding; I once was told "the only thing that matters is what can get funded" so where does that leave still necessary work on security, innovation, and operational resilience?
	* "Grunt work" is still personally profitable, but requires a portfolio of successes and 'employability'
* From 'graduated' to FTE (Full-Time Employment/Equivalency)
	* Internships and associate roles
	* Time in a foreign context / location / economy
	* Demonstrable 'continued learning paths'
	* People networking, new connections, and communities of practice
	* Fairness (or not) in hiring processes


There's only so much you yourself can do to widen your surface area of opportunity without the help/support/action of others...so do that!

* Meeting in person is still more powerful than only-online engagement
	* Regional tech events: conferences, meetups, hackathons
* Virtual events: hack and skill-up days
* ...or build your own community/group (long-tail, not immediate payoff)

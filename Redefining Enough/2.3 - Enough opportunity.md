*BLUF: The high tech employment market is brutal frequently, for entry and 'exiting' candidates alike, but there's work to do if you can find the right networks and get past the filters.*

* How many graduates vs. how many open jobs at an entry level or higher
	* Graduation stats
		* 4-5% YoY increase; doubled from 2013-2023 (ref: [NSCH](https://www.studentclearinghouse.org/nscblog/computer-science-has-highest-increase-in-bachelors-earners/))
	* [Thread](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/over-supply-of-cs-grads/3667125/4): does an over-supply really signal greater difficulty in getting a job?
	* [SIU summary](https://cs.siu.edu/jobsvsgrads-image.php) of BLS data, CS jobs vs. grads: despite a rush on tech edu, still worth getting some
* There's always more than enough work to do
	* Despite the GenAI trends, most automation still requires skilled human eyes and exercise to prove correctness, completeness, stability, and reliability
	* Budgets often define what's being worked on more than it is need
	* AI is the current "Hail Mary" in the post-pandemic economic landscape to attract funding; I once was told "the only thing that matters is what can get funded" so where does that leave still necessary work on security, innovation, and operational resilience?
	* "Grunt work" is still personally profitable, but requires a portfolio of successes and 'employability'
* From 'graduated' to FTE (Full-Time Employment/Equivalency)
	* Internships and associate roles
	* Time in a foreign context / location / economy
	* Demonstrable 'continued learning paths'
	* People networking, new connections, and communities of practice
	* Fairness (or not) in hiring processes

There are examples of high-tech companies that grow, ethically and sustainably, but are fewer that otherwise:

* [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) / [Edith Harbaugh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edithharbaugh)
* Honeycomb.io / [Christine Yen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christineyen) and [Charity Majors](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charity-majors)
* [Ti.to](https://teamtito.com/about) and Vi.to Community / [Paul Campbell](https://twitter.com/paulca) and [Doc Parsons](https://x.com/drbparsons)

Side-note: if you can use ChatGPT without proper nouns/names to generate a 90%+ match to an employer's mission statement and values, it's likely they did too and they don't actually espouse or embody them.

## Bottom-line:

There's only so much you yourself can do to widen your surface area of opportunity without the help/support/action of others...so do that!

* Meeting in person is still more powerful than only-online engagement
	* Regional tech events: conferences, meetups, hackathons
* Virtual events: hack and skill-up days
* ...or build your own community/group (long-tail, not immediate payoff)

*BLUF: Your journey is not the same as your career. Prepare to be a life-long learner and be as flexible to change as possible.*

* Everything changes: business, high tech, nature...you need to change with it
* Four key areas I've found important to managing my own journey
	* [[3.1 - Enough learning]]
	* [[3.2 - Enough synthesis]]
	* [[3.3 - Enough process]]
	* [[3.4 - Enough support]]
* 'Enough' is like figuring out the differential equations of you
	* Independent variables - things that you can't change or take a long time to
	* Dependent variables - things you might change, and their relationship to IVs
	* What is the limit of the value of your current function given the input/argument?
	* Equations change too, more specific/accurate, more complicated; is simple always the most elegant?

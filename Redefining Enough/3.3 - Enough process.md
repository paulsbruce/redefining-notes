* Process isn't a bad word. 
	* Many people acquire negative associations with the concept/word 'process' due to implementations that are seemingly confusing, inequitable, non-optimal, or inconvenient
	* There are many processes that you likely agree are beneficial
		* Driving schools: level knowledge about how to drive on shared roads
		* Payroll: epically important once or twice a month, takes effort in between
		* Water and waste treatment
		* Food handling and processing standards, safety inspections
		* Automated build, test, deploy pipelines
	* Not everyone agrees because not everyone gets the same value from:
		* Audits
		* Agile ceremonies: standup, backlog grooming and refinement, retrospectives
		* Trunk-based vs. branches; levels and types of automated testing
		* Ticket-based support systems: customer, internal, IT
* Personal processes
	* Hygiene: digital, mental and otherwise; messy life, messy outputs and results
	* Regimen: sustainability and sanity in the face of chaos
	* Measurability and KPIs (to achieve goals)
	* 
* Professional processes
	* Capturing and documenting successes and failures
	* Formal/HR performance programs
	* Always have a "why/roadmap" deck at the ready
	* Developing human relationships beyond the immediate pool/team of co-workers
		* Example: #mugclub
	* Example: Growgistics, AgTech Incubator
		* Incubation is a process
			* Needs as input: ideas, ideation is a process too
			* Needs to output: credible investments, documented, placement
			* Needs a network of investment sources, accelerators, and contributors
		* Processes MUST change and improve

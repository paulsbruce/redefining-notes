*BLUF: Understand your hierarchy of needs (e.g. Maslow), your current position(s), and act to increment each front accordingly.*

* Context: [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)
	* You as a whole vs. the multiple facets of your life
	* 'Objective' assessment of each facet in relation to your hierarchy (e.g. personal, professional, economic, etc.); how can you really be...without some feedback?
* Your personal support system
	* Family and friends - human connection, unrelated to job circumstances
	* Communities - "like-minded", topically-driven; codes of conduct
	* 'Self-imposed watersheds': You-cons (purpose-driven staycations)
* Economic support
	* Financial aid: temporary for students, grants same; short-lived with conditions
	* Social safety nets: never 'enough', but better than nothing (effort vs. impact)?
	* 'Compounding interest/s': people from your network that funnel interest your way
	* Building your own economic buffers over time; more than just 'saving', short and long-term financial planning; take a financial advisor out to lunch
* At the job
	* Support from your immediate team
	* Support beyond your team/boss
	* Support from leadership / executive decisioning

		* What you need from others, what they need from you
		* Moral/morale vs. decisive vs. funding support
* Whether high or low, on many or few facets
	* Ask yourself what's the next important increment on each front
	* Generate multiple options, don't just pick the first that comes to mind
	* Seek input from others, engage them willingly, and take time to synthesize

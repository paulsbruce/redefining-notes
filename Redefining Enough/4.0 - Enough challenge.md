*BLUF: 'Enough' and 'not enough' are range boundaries you can change. Change takes energy and all expenditures should come with a reason ("why"). Challenge your boundaries or someone else will.*

The spectrum of 'enough' is just one dimension and sometimes a false dichotomy when paired with another dimension, such as now vs. then, useful vs. not useful, etc.

* [[4.1 - Enough to get where?]]
* [[4.2 - Not enough]]
* [[4.3 - Never enough]]
* [[4.4 - Enough said]]

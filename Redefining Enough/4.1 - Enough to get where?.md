*BLUF: Understand and refine where and why you are going in the direction you're going. Break apart the 'unknown future state' problem into factors and reverse engineer how to get to ideal. If something's too big, break it down further. Rinse and repeat.*

* Where you're going involves multiple factors
	* Goals: short vs. long, roadmap
		* Example: my own roadmap?
	* Focus: objectives to support goals, perceived compound value
		* GSOT: Goal, Strategy, Objectives, Tactics
		* Who's tactics are who's goals? Concentric rings of GSOT for levels of organizations
	* Economics: cashflow, debt, expense, income, investment
	* Support: academic resources, network, systems of people
* Now vs. future factors
	* Mechanisms of overflow: sequencing matters
	* Goals
		* Now goals: complete degree program but what next?
		* Future goals: how does the degree support...what?
	* Et cetera...
	* Change must occur, but what, when, and WHY?
	* Analogy:
		* Requirements now vs. later
			* Now requirements produce work and deliverables that result in outcomes
			* Outcomes of prior work should benefit future work, yes?
			* Thus, future requirements should include intel/info of prior requirements
		* The 'real' requirements might not have changed, but our understanding does
			* PMBOK "progressive elaboration" - anticipate and plan for space to adjust
			* Example: 
	* Learning and improvement is inherently iterative

* Where you're going involves multiple factors
	* Goals: short vs. long, roadmap
	* Focus: objectives to support goals, perceived compound value
	* Economics: cashflow, debt, expense, income, investment
	* Support: academic resources, network, systems or people
* Now vs. future factors
	* Goals
		* Now goals: complete degree program but what next?
		* Future goals: how does the degree support...what?
	* Et cetera...
	* Change must occur, but what, when, and WHY?
	* Analogy:
		* Requirements now vs. later
			* Now requirements produce work and deliverables that result in outcomes
			* Outcomes of prior work should benefit future work, yes?
			* Thus, future requirements should include intel/info of prior requirements
		* The 'real' requirements might not have changed, but our understanding does
			* PMBOK "progressive elaboration" - anticipate and plan for space to adjust
			* Example: 
	* Learning and improvement nis inherently iterative

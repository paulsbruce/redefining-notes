BLUF: 

* Since 'enough' is an N-body problem, 'good enough' on not all is 'not enough'
	* Must find minimum-viable aspects for yourself, some are common between us
	* Each of these aspects aren't viable alone: credentials, experience, passion
* Minimum wage is NOT enough
	* Massachusetts: $15/hr; 37.5hr/wk x 48wks = 1800hrs/yr = $27,000/yr (pre-tax)
	* US Federal: $7.50/hr ... == $13,500/yr
	* Federal poverty line = $15,060
	* Some social service / safety nets but varies state to state; not enough is not respectable
* Enough for the all of us
	* The world is big, global population of 7bn+; will there ever be 'enough' resources?
	* For those with privilege historically, stepping up sometimes means stepping aside
	* Building systems with generative compound value; more out than in over time
* Not enough professionally
	* Software Engineers (SWEs) should never feel that their current domain knowledge is enough
		* For users/customers: ways to explore their challenge areas, recognized or not
	* 'Work/life balance' paradigms vs. integrated/continuous balance
	* Number of effort areas...not enough or too many?

Ultimately, be acutely aware of moments where you might slip into thinking that your journey and decisions are not on you. There are always constraints and limits to what you control, but own your own learning paths and opportunities.
